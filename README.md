# Jupiter-JUP-on-Solana
I see **Jupiter (JUP)** on Solana not just as another altcoin, but as the backbone of liquidity in the ecosystem. It’s already the leading DEX aggregator, processing millions of trades daily. For me, JUP is a bet on Solana’s future — if the network grows, Jupiter’s role only strengthens. Sure, risks remain with market volatility and competition, but I view this token as a long-term play on infrastructure and trust.
Here’s a possible continuation in the same first-person style:
That’s why I don’t treat JUP like a quick flip — it’s more of a conviction hold. Every time I see new protocols integrate with Jupiter or developers building on top of its APIs, it reinforces my thesis. Liquidity is the lifeblood of any blockchain economy, and Jupiter has positioned itself as the main artery. I’m not blind to the fact that narratives shift fast in crypto, but having a token tied to actual usage and flow feels different. To me, JUP isn’t just exposure to Solana — it’s exposure to the efficiency of the entire ecosystem.
